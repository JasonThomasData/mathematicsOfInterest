    "### Penalty methods\n",
    "\n",
    "To as in linear programming, we can apply constraints to non-linear optimisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can design a linear program to have constraints, and then turn the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Then we can use unconstrained algorithms (like descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "A trivial example will help:\n",
    "\n",
    "![trivial example](Screenshot_2023-09-04_09-56-14.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution below it follows this method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ x = 1 \\to x - 1 = 0 $\n",
    "- Square the new function: $ (x-1)^2 $\n",
    "- add a penalty parameter $ \\sigma $ so that we can decrease \n",
    "- divide it by 2\n",
    "- the above forms a term that we add to $ x $. Now we can set $ \\sigma $ to be a large number and then descend $ x $\n",
    "\n",
    "![different values of sigma](Screenshot_2023-09-04_10-19-54.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, this shows that this gets closer to the feasible value. Never actually gets there. We _shift_ the penalty so that it becomes an augmented lagrangian.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic method\n",
    "\n",
    "- Choose a sequence of $ \\sigma_k \\to \\infty $ as $ k \\to \\infty$ . $ \\{ 10_k \\} $ will do the job.\n",
    "- For every $ \\sigma_k $\n",
    "- Find the minimum of each, $ x_k = x(\\sigma_k )$\n",
    "- Stop finding $ x_k $ when the difference between the the difference between $ x_k $ and the feasible region (originally given as $ x=1 $ are almost the same point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instability\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example $ \\sigma_k \\to \\infty $, so this hints at instability. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can introduce another parameter to help stabilise this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ \\sigma $ be a shift parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "![shift param](Screenshot_2023-09-04_10-58-44.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise what happened above:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The shift param $ \\theta $ reduces the stability effects as $ k \\to \\infty $\n",
    "- Take the derivative of the new function with respect to $ x $\n",
    "- Solve for the new param, $ \\theta $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agumented lagrangian\n",
    "\n",
    "The shifted penalty method corresponds to the augmented lagrangian. This is way too much for me to write down at the moment.\n",
