    "### Duality of a linear program\n",

    "See the notebook on standard forms (and canonical forms) for linear programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ c $ be a vector of coefficients for the objective function (single column matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ x $ be a vector of decision variables, of length $ n_x $ (single column matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ b $ be a vector of values that are the RHS of constraint functions, of length $ n_b $ (single column matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ A $ be a matrix of constraints (LHS, WHAT IS IT CALLED)? Its order should be $ n_b \\times n_x $\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a standard form for either a min or max program, called _opt_ for now:\n",

    "__LP__\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} opt & c^T x \\\\ & Ax & = & b \\\\ & x & \\ge & 0 \\end{matrix} \\right. $\n",

    "Then it's dual is like the inverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think a solution being the optimum, according to an analysis argument, depends on the dual.\n",
    "\n",
    "_If the objective function of the dual, with optimal decision variables substituted, has the same vale as the objective function for the $ LP $ then we can say that optimal decision variables found in the LP are in fact the optimal_.\n",

    "\n",
    "To find the Dual, take this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Swap $ c \\leftrightarrow b $\n",
    "- The objective coefficients $ x \\to \\lambda $\n",
    "- $ \\mu $ is some slack variable, so that you can express the function as an equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the Dual in terms of $ \\mu $ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} opt^{-1} & b^T \\lambda \\\\ & A^T\\lambda + \\mu & = & c \\\\ & \\mu & \\ge & 0 \\end{matrix} \\right.$\n",
    "\n",
    "And this is the same as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\left\\{ \\begin{matrix} opt^{-1} & b^T \\lambda \\\\ & A^T\\lambda & \\le & c \\end{matrix} \\right.$\n",
    "\n",
    "__The Dual of a Dual is the original program_\n",
    "\n",
    "To validate that our optimum is the optimum, we should check that the total value for the objective function evaluates to the same value in each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In Matlab, Gnu Octave etc\n",
    "\n",
    "In these programs it's possible to use a solver that will find the optimal values for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "They should also return $ \\lambda $ values. Check that:\n",
