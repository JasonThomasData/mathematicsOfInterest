    "### Stability analysis of non-linear systems (linearisation)\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a two-dimensional system of autonomous equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "![system to study](Screenshot_2023-04-17_16-26-48.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can study the equilibrium of the system at $ (x^*, y^*) = (1, 1) $, which is the saddle in the middle. We can see that it's a saddle (qualitative) but can we also confirm it using stability analysis (analytic).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is this:\n",
    "- Change of variables: move the equilibrium to the origin\n",
    "- Eliminate higher order (non-linear) terms\n",
    "- Using the linearised system, find eigenvalues to do this\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because once we have linearised the non-linear system via a change of variables, and when the equilbrium is at the origin, then eigenvalues will be useful ______.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ u = x - 1, v = y - 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good choice because the system after changing variables will be shifted by this ammount, above. Then the new system will have its equilibrium at the origin $ (0,0) $.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{du}{dt} = \\frac{d(x-1)}{dt} = \\frac{d(x)}{dt} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "Now rewrite $ u, v $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x = u + 1, y = v + 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "And look at what we're working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = 2x \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{2} \\right) - xy $\n",
    "\n",
    "Expand it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\left(2x - x^2 \\right) - xy $\n",
    "\n",
    "Substitute in the change of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{du}{dt} = \\left(2(u+1) - (u+1)^2 \\right) - (u+1)(v+1) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{du}{dt} = \\left((2u+2) - (u^2 + 2u + 1) \\right) - (uv + u + v + 1) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{du}{dt} = 2u + 2 - u^2 - 2u - 1 - uv - u - v - 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{du}{dt} = - u^2 - uv - u - v $\n",
    "\n",
    "Do the same for the other equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dy}{dt} = 3y \\left(1 - \\frac{y}{3} \\right) - 2xy $\n",
    "\n",
    "And do the same process as before, the result is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dv}{dt} = -2u - v - 2uv - v^2 $ \n",
    "\n",
    "So now we have this system of equations with an equilibrium at $ (0,0) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{du}{dt} = - u^2 - uv - u - v $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dv}{dt} = -2u - v - 2uv - v^2 $ \n",
    "\n",
    "But since $ u, v $ are both very small (WHY IS THIS I DON'T GET WHY) then the non-linear terms are much smaller than the linear terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{du}{dt} \\approx - u - v $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dv}{dt} \\approx -2u - v $ \n",
    "\n",
    "If you convert this to a matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\left[ \\begin{matrix} -1 & -1 \\\\ -2 & -1 \\end{matrix} \\right] \\left[ \\begin{matrix} u \\\\ v \\end{matrix} \\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you could find the determinant using $ \\lambda $, and using the characteristic equation, we find that the eigenvalues are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\lambda = -1 \\pm \\sqrt{2} $\n",
