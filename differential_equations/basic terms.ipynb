    "### Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependent and independent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Used when talking about functions generally. $ y = f(x) $ means $ y $ is dependent and $ x $ is independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameter\n",
    "\n",
    "Those parts of a differential equation or solution that are not variables. The objective of finding a particular solution might be to find the values of parameters for an initial condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Initial condition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $ \\frac{dy}{dt} = f(x) $ then $ f(x=0) $ is an initial condition. From what I can tell, it is most useful to represent it as an ordered pair $ (x,y) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Let a differential equation be $ \\frac{dy}{dx} $. Then the solution is the integral if using analytic method. You might use a numeric method to approximate the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise called a family of solutions. It will have a $ c $ in it hopefully, since this should be an integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Particular solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a general solution and an initial condition, then you can solve for $ c $. This will be the particular solution where the general solution passes through the initial condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equilibrium solution\n",
    "\n",
    "If a solution doesn't change with respect to a variable, then the graph should look constant along one axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Non-linear\n",
    "\n",
    "Given $ \\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) $, then if $ f(x) $ is no-linear, then the equation is also non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### First-order system\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two ODEs (AND CAN THERE BE MORE?) then each ODE will have a different dependent variable but will have the same indepedent variable. Both equations should be first-order differential equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg, let $ \\alpha, \\beta, \\gamma, \\delta $ be parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dA}{dt} = \\alpha A(t) - \\beta A(t)B(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dB}{dt} = \\gamma B(t) + \\delta A(t)B(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Methods to finding solutions\n",
    "- analytical - we use integration (are there other techniques?) to find precise formulas for solutions\n",
    "- qualitative - we use a slope field to understand how a family of solutions would behave\n",
    "- numeric - we approximate a particular solution (but what about general solutions)? Do we need to approximate the general solution and then approximate an initial condition before we find the particular solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autonomous differential equation\n",
    "This is a differential equation where $ \\frac{dy}{dx} = f(y) $. The slope field for this will depict parallel gradients along any horizontal line you draw.\n"
