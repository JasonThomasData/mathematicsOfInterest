    "### Competition via consumption of resources (Lotka Volterra Models)\n",
    "\n",
    "These can be used to understand how two populations compete with each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Via exploitation - one species affects another by consuming a shared resource. This is an indirect effect.\n",
    "- Via interference - one species interferes with another's ability to use a resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook concentrates on the first but there is a separate notebook for the second\n",
    "\n",
    "### Species affect each other via exploitation\n",
    "\n",
    "If left on its own, either species will approach the carrying capacity for the environment. When they compete there are 4 possible scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ N_1 $ causes the extinction of $ N_2 $\n",
    "- $ N_2 $ causes the extinction of $ N_1 $\n",
    "- $ N_1, N_2 $ are able to coexist\n",
    "- $ N_1, N_2 $ are extinct\n",

    "Consider a model that describes each population:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1 N_1(1 - \\frac{N_1}{K_1}) $\n",

    "\n",
    "Perhaps this is two petri dishes containing each a different bacteria, and some substrate in each. Each dish has its own carrying capacity $ K $.\n",
    "\n",
    "A way to think about the logistic models is that it displays the intra-species competition. That is, competition between the members of a species amongst themselves. That's why as the population approaches the carrying capacity, then the growth rate slows.\n",

    "#### Lotka-Volterra Competition Model\n",

    "Then to include a notion of inter-species competition, we can say:\n",

    "$ \\frac{dN_1}{dt} = r_1 N_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{N_1 + \\alpha N_2}{K_1} \\right) = r_1 N_1 \\left(\\frac{K_1 - N_1 - \\alpha N_2}{K_1} \\right) $\n",
