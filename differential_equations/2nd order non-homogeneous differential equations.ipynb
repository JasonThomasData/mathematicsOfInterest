    "#### Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real world systems take the form of 2nd order DEs. These are often harmonic oscillators and there is a notebook about this application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2nd order non-homogeneous differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "The key here is these are non-homogeneous. See the other notebook about homogeneous equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example that we would get from thinking about Harmonic Oscillators.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ m \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + b \\frac{dy}{dt} + ky = f(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ m \\ne 0 $ then we can change the variables by dividing $ m $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p \\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = g(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be relatively easy to find the homogeneous equation associated with this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p \\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "So let's do that to make our life easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that on the phase plane then this homogeneous DE is a stable sink while $ p, k > 0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using the extended linearity principle\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a notebook on this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y_h = c_1 y_1(t) + c_2 y_2(t) $ is a general solution of the homogeneous equation. Recall above it was mentioned this is a stable sink and it tends towards $ 0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y_p $ is a particular solution to the non-homogeneous equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = c_1 y_1(t) + c_2 y_2(t) + y_p $ is the general solution for the non-homogeneous equation\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = y_h + y_p $\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ y_h $ tends to $ 0 $ then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y \\approx y_p $ as $ t \\to \\infty $\n",
    "\n",
    "But my observation would be that $ y_p $ (the non-homogeneous particular solution) tends towards its equilibrium while the $ y_h $ (homogeous particular solution) tends towards its equilibrium of $ 0 $. So then these two combined means the system at large tends towards a combination of the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecturer's words, the natural response dies while the forcing responce remains (in terms of harmonic oscillators).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A general method for finding the general solution\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ m \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + b \\frac{dy}{dt} + ky = f(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + p \\frac{dy}{dt} + qy = g(t) $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Find $ y_h $, which is the general solution to the homogenous equation\n",
    "\n",
    "- find $ y_p $, which is the particular solution to the larger homnogeneous equation. Do this using the method of undetermined coefficients (which involves guessing). The notebook on the Linearity Principle includes tips for guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The general solution will be $ y_g = y_h + y_p $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 5\\frac{dy}{dt} + 6y = e^{-t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Let the homogeneous part be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 5\\frac{dy}{dt} + 6y = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then for this the eigenvalues are: $ \\lambda_1 = -2, \\lambda = -3 $\n",
    "\n",
    "And this has the general solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y_h = c_1 e^{-2t} + c_2 e^{-3t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need a particular solution for the non-homogeneous equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 5\\frac{dy}{dt} + 6y = e^{-t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can guess that $ y = ke^{-t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ ke^{-t} - 5ke^{-t} + 6ke^{-t} = e^{-t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ ke^{-t} - 5ke^{-t} + 6ke^{-t} = e^{-t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 2ke^{-t} = e^{-t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this is true if $ k = \\frac{1}{2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y_p = \\frac{1}{2}e^{-t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then using the extended linearity principle, the general solution to the non-homogeneous equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y_g = c_1 e^{-2t} + c_2 e^{-3t} + \\frac{1}{2}e^{-t}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example with Trig function RHS\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 4\\frac{dy}{dt} + 6y = \\cos t $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now find the solution for the homogeneous differential equation like normal:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{d^2y}{dt^2} + 4\\frac{dy}{dt} + 6y = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then these have complex roots: $ -2 \\pm i\\sqrt{2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $ y = e^{(-2 + i\\sqrt{2})t} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ e^{(-2 + i\\sqrt{2})t} = e^{-2t} e^{(\\sqrt{2})it} $\n",
    "\n",
    "We employ Euler's Identity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ e^{-2t} e^{(\\sqrt{2})it} = e^{-2t} \\left(\\cos (\\sqrt{2})t + i \\sin (\\sqrt{2})t \\right) $\n",
    "\n",
    "With the theorem on page 304 of Blanchard, we can now say that the general solution is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y_h = c_1 e^{-2t} \\cos (\\sqrt{2})t + c_2 e^{-2t} \\sin (\\sqrt{2})t $\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to find the particular solution $ y_p $\n",
    "\n",
    "Guess:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = \\alpha \\cos t + \\beta \\sin t $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (- \\alpha \\cos t - \\beta \\sin t ) + 4(- \\alpha \\sin t + \\beta \\cos t ) + 6(\\alpha \\cos t + \\beta \\sin t ) = \\cos t $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (- \\alpha \\cos t - \\beta \\sin t ) + (- 4\\alpha \\sin t + 4\\beta \\cos t ) + (6\\alpha \\cos t + 6\\beta \\sin t ) = \\cos t $\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$ (\\cos t )(5\\alpha + 4\\beta) + (\\sin t)(-4\\alpha + 5\\beta) = \\cos t $\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Note the first line is $ 1 $ because it is a multiple of $ \\cos t $, as is the RHS."
