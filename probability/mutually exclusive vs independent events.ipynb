    "### Difference between mutually exclusive events and independent events\n",
    "\n",
    "Events that are mutually exclusive are those that have no chance of occuring at the same moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: for a single trial of a random experiment where we flip a single fair coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\Omega = \\{ H, T \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if you draw a venn diagram for this single trial you will see that there is no overlap. The events circles will have no $ P(H \\cap T \\} $ part.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A \\cap B) = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "And this means that mutually exclusive events can't be independent events.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because an independent event is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A)P(B)}{P(B)} = P(A) $\n"
