    "### Basic terms in probability\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Random experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "A situation that does not depend on any other experiments. For example, a coin flip. This experiment can involve a fair or loaded coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any process which is subject to variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Trial\n",
    "\n",
    "A moment in the experiment. For example, if the random experiment says to flip two coins then a trial is to flip both coins and record the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of a single trial. Might be more than one occurence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple event\n",
    "\n",
    "If a trial requires you to flip two coins, then when you flip either coin this will give you a simple event. A head or tail might occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compound event\n",
    "\n",
    "If a trial requires more than one simple event then this is also called a compound event.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample space\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the set of all possible outcomes for an experiment. This is denoted by $ \\Omega $.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the experiment is to flip a coin then $ \\Omega = \\{H, T\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "If the experiment is to flip two coins then $ \\Omega = \\{HH, HT, TH, TT\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "If the experiment is to roll 1d6 then the sample space is $ \\Omega = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Event\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use this term to refer to either a simple or compound event.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ \\Omega = \\{HH,HT,TH,TT\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "And a trial is to flip two coins then the event might be that the first coin is $ H $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the compound event is $ E = \\{HH, HT \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The event might be that at least one coin is $ T $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the compound event is $ E = \\{HT, TH, TT \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Probability of x occuring, single random experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability of something is the chance of that occuring, or a simple event, divided by all possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability of rolling a 5 with 1d6.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{1}{6} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability of rolling a 5 or 6 with 1d6.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{1}{6} + \\frac{1}{6} = \\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability of drawing a heart from a deck of cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{13}{52} = \\frac{1}{4} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of \"or\" like plus and \"and\" like multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Odds\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a single random experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The odds is the probability of an event occuring divided by the probability of it not occuring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: the odds of rolling a 6 with 1d6.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{1}{6} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Or not:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{5}{6} $\n",
    " \n",
    "The odds:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{1/6}{5/6} = \\frac{1}{6} * \\frac{6}{5} = \\frac{6}{30} = 1:5 $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Odds ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two random experiments, with different probabilities and therefore different odds also.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling a 1 with a fair 1d6:\n",
    "\n",
    "odds = $ 1/6 : 5/6 = 1:5 = 0.2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Flipping a head with a loaded coin:\n",
    "\n",
    "odds = $ .7 : .3 = 2.\\dot 3 $\n",
    "\n",
    "odds ratio = $ \\frac{2. \\dot 3}{0.2} = 11.\\dot 6 $\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that flipping a head with the example loaded coin is $ 11. \\dot 6$ times greater than the odds of rolling 1 with a 1d6.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unconditional probability\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A) $ the probability of $ A $ regardless of any other information. If the total count is 100 then $ P(A) = A/100 $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conditional probability\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A|B) $ the probability of $ A $ given $ B $, see the relevant notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Symmetry\n",
    "\n",
    "If a random experiment has a finite number of possible outcomes, and we cannot say that one is more likely than the other, then the probability of each outcome is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(outcome) = \\frac{1}{n} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ n $ is the number of possible outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "EG: if we have a symmetric die, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(outcome) = \\frac{1}{6} $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prior probability\n",
    "\n",
    "DEFINE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subjective assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of assigning subjective prior probability"
