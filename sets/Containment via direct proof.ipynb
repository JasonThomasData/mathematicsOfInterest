    "### Containment via direct proof\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARZqP6CkCHU\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: does the statement make sense?\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (A \\cap B) \\subset (A \\cup B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense, since the set of things that overlap is necessarily the smallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "It can help to draw the statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A and B](A_B.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "So this makes sense, so let's continue to try and prove it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: if you don't have a plan to use induction or contradiction (this means we proceed via direct proof)\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a plan to do anything else, it's good to write things as an implication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\forall x : x \\in (A \\cap B) \\rightarrow x \\in (A \\cup B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: which part do we assume to be true?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is referred to as the hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take this for granted:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x \\in (A \\cap B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we wish to show:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x \\in (A \\cup B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Decompose the hypothesis into definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x \\in (A \\cap B) $ means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (x \\in A) \\wedge (x \\in B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "This yields a useful result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Decompose what we want to show into definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x \\in (A \\cup B) $ means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (x \\in A) \\vee (x \\in B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: Use direct proof to link the hypothesis to the unknown\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x \\in (A \\cap B) $ means $ x \\in A \\wedge x \\in B $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this means that $ x \\in A \\vee x \\in B $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this implies the statement in step 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\forall x : x \\in (A \\cap B) \\rightarrow x \\in (A \\cup B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "So by direct proof, the statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (A \\cap B) \\subset (A \\cup B) $\n",
    "\n",
    "is correct."
