    "### Relation\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary relation is a relation that associates elements of one set with another set. These are called the domain and co-domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equivalence relation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "$ (x, y, z) \\in X \\times X \\times X $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ R $ be some relation on set $ X $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ R $ is an equivalence relation if it satisfies these conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is Reflexive\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x R y \\space\\space \\forall (x, y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, every element of $ X $ relates to every other element.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is symmetric\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x R y = y R x \\space\\space \\forall (x, y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this relation has the intuitive property of commutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is transitive\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ x R y $ and $ y R z $ then $ x R z $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the functional notion of composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "_Given a set and a relation, you should check that the relation on the set meets the conditions before you say it's an equivalence relation on the set._\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Equivalence class\n",
    "\n",
    "Take some element in the set. It is a representative of its equivalence class. Its equivalence class is the set of all elements that are equivalent:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ [x] = \\{(x, y) \\in X\\times X: x R y \\} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "Note this is expressed as the cross product because the equivalence class includes the representative element for the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "$ R = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{N} \\times \\mathbb{N} : x + y < 7 \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check it satisfies the conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reflexive:\n",
    "\n",
    "This fails at $ 4R4 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Because: $ 4+4 \\not < 7 $\n",
    "\n",
    "So $ R $ is not an equivalence relation on the natural numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second attempt\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's restrict the set to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A = \\{1,2,3\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's check it satisfies the conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reflexive:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 1R1, 2R2, 3R3 $ are all valid\n",
    "\n",
    "- Symmetric\n",
    "\n",
    "Addition is a commutitive operator, so this is symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transitive\n",
    "\n",
    "This is true for all elements in $ A $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 1+2 <7, 2+3 < 7 $ and also, $ 1+3 < 7 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore this is transitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the relation $ R $ is not an equivalence relation on the set $ \\mathbb{N} $ but is on the set $ A = \\{1,2,3 \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalence class could be stated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ [1] = \\{1,2,3\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ [2] = \\{1,2,3\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ [3] = \\{1,2,3\\} $"
