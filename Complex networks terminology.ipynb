    "### Complex Networks - terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "- Network - often this is a real world example of a graph. Eg. social networ.\n",
    "- Graph - this is more of an abstract notion\n",
    "- Links - what is known as an edge in Graph Theory. I prefer the term edge.\n",
    "- Nodes - what is known as a vertex in Graph Theory. Called \"nodes\" for future reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of graphs, or networks\n",
    "- Directed - each edge has a direction. Eg links on the internet, citation networks\n",
    "- Undirected - each edge is directed both ways. Eg a sexual contact newtork, gene coexpression network\n",
    "- Weighted - useful for replacing several edges with a single edge that has a numerical measure\n",
    "- Simple - \n",
    "- Bipartite - the nodes are in two exclusive sets, but the graph only includes edges between the different types. There are no edges between the same type. Eg: a graph of directors who are linked to the actors in their movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other terms\n",
    "- Self loop - an edge that has the same tail and head\n",
    "- Multiple edges - where two nodes or vertices share more than one edge\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weighted networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thresholding - a process by which we exclude some edges, based on their weight being sufficient or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bipartite Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "- One mode projection - where we get rid of one kind of node, but maintain the information about the links."
