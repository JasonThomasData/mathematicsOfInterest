    "### Diagonal of Product Topology and $ T_2 $ spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "This is to show that a topological space $ (X, \\mathcal{T}) $ is $ T_2 $ iff the diagonal $ \\Delta = \\{ (x, x) \\in X \\times X: x \\in X \\} $ is closed in the Cartesian product $ X \\times X $ equipped with the product topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "LtR:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $ (X, \\mathcal{T}) $ is $ T_2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that a point falls on the line when the two values $ x, y $ are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ (x, y) \\in X \\times X $ \\ $ \\Delta(x) $, aka point not on diagonal\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists disjoint open sets $ A, B $ such that $ x \\in A, y \\in B $ and $ A \\cap B = \\emptyset $. This is due to the space being $ T_2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A \\times B \\subseteq (X \\times X) $ \\ $ \\Delta(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the cartesian product of two open sets is open, then we know that $ A \\times B \\subseteq (X \\times X) $ is open and that means:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (X \\times X) $ \\ $ \\Delta(x) $ is open, because an open set with elements removed doesn't become closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the complement of that is $ \\Delta(x) $, which is closed because it is the complement of an open set.\n",
    "\n",
    "RtL:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $ \\Delta(x) $ is closed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ x \\ne y $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $ (x, y) \\in (X \\times X) $ \\ $ \\Delta(x) $ must be open, because it's the complement of a closed set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists an open set $ G $, with $ (x, y) \\in G $ and $ G \\subseteq (X \\times X) $ \\ $ \\Delta(x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The basis that would give us this set $ G $ would include open sets $ A, B $.\n",

    "$ A \\times B \\subseteq G \\subseteq (X \\times X) $ \\ $ \\Delta(x) $\n",
