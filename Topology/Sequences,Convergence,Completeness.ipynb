    "### Sequences, convergence, completeness\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence in a set $ X $ is a list of elements of $ X $ that are indexed by the natural numbers. This implies there is order.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sequence can also be thought of as a function $ f: \\mathbb{N} \\to X $. It's a function from the natural numbers to the set $ X $. Again this implies order.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ f(n) = x_n $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can think of convergence here as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an analysis course we could say:\n",
    "\n",
    "_A sequence $ x_n $ converges to a limit $ a \\in x $ iff $ \\exists n, \\forall \\epsilon > 0 , \\forall M > n : |x_M - a | < \\epsilon $_\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can also think of it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a - \\epsilon < x_n < a + \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "But instead of this absolute difference, we can define a metric.\n",

    "_A sequence $ x_n $ converges in a metric space $ (X, \\rho) $ to a limit $ a \\in x $ iff $ \\exists n, \\forall \\epsilon > 0 , \\forall M > n : \\rho(x_M, a) < \\epsilon $_\n",

    "To take a more topological bent on this notion of convergence:\n",

    "$ \\rho(x_n, a) < \\epsilon $ iff $ n_n \\in B(a; \\epsilon) $, as in, an open ball.\n",

    "_A sequence $ x_n $ converges in a topological space $ (X, \\mathcal{T}) $ to $ a \\in X $ iff for any open set $ G: a \\in G, \\forall M > n : x_M \\in G $_\n",

    "#### Example, convergence in a topological space\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_n = \\frac{1}{n} $. In $ \\mathbb{R} $ with the Euclidean Topology, $ \\lim_\\limits{n \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{1}{n} \\right) = 0 $\n",

    "#### Eventually constant\n",
    "\n",
    "Theorem: In a discrete topological space, a sequence converges iff it is eventually constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "_The intuitive notion of eventually constant is that there is some element in the sequence such that index, all following elements are equal._\n",

    "__Proof:__\n",

    "Let $ (X, \\mathcal{T}) $ be any set with the discrete topology.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) Suppose that in the space the sequence converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\forall x \\in X: {x} \\in \\mathcal{T} $, because we're using the finest topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then one of the singleton sets in $\\mathcal{T} $ is the value that the sequence converges to.\n",
    "\n",
    "That the sequence converges implies the sequence is eventually constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Suppose that the sequence is eventually constant\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the limit of the sequence, as the index $ n \\to \\infty $, is some element in $ X $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discrete topology is the finest topology so $ \\{x\\} \\in \\mathcal{T} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if the limit of the sequence is in the topology, we say this converges in the topological space.\n",

    "I showed the lecturer my proof and he said:\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "`You need to apply the definition of convergence more precisely. Namely, for any open neighbourhood U of the limit point x, there exists an N such that n>N implies x_n in U. Then specifically choosing U = {x} shows the sequence is eventually constant.`\n",

    "#### One Point Compactification\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a thing that's not compact and then we can add a point to make it compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, $ \\infty $ here is just a name and it is just a point that we add. I think that since $ \\mathbb{N} $ is infinite then the new point is in a neighbourhood with infinitely many neighbours.\n",

    "A sequence $ s: \\mathbb{N} \\to X $, (also written $ s(n) = x_n $), in a topological space $ X $, converges (in the space) iff $ s $ extends to a continuous function:\n",

    "#### Cauchy sequences in metric spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a Cauchy Sequence allows us to think about convergence without defining a limit specifically.\n",

    "The same notion can be applied to metric spaces.\n",

    "This is the standard definition of Cauchy Sequence, but instead of absolute value, we use a metric (as in, this could be the absolute value metric but it's more abstract).\n",

    "![pic of proof](Screenshot_2023-05-20_20-58-07.png)\n",
