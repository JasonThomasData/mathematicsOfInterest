    "### Generating topologies\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have some set and you have some functions that you would like to be continuous, then can we define a topology so that those functions become continuous?\n",
    "\n",
    "The product topology has two functions. Each projects a cartesian coordinate (for example in $\\mathbb{R}^2$) to its $ x $ or $ y $ component. We define it by taking the most coarse topology so that the functions are continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "$ S \\subseteq P(X) $ The topology on $ X $ generated by $ S $ is the coarsest (smallest) topology on $ X $ such that every element of $ S $ is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Generating a topology from an intersection of topologies\n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection of topologies is another topology. The union of topologies isn't necessarily a topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ \\{ \\mathcal{T}_\\lambda : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\} $ be a non-empty set of topologies on $ X $. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then $ \\mathcal{T} = \\bigcap_\\limits{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} \\mathcal{T}_\\lambda $\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $ G \\subseteq X $ is open wrt $ \\mathcal{T} $ iff $ G $ is open wrt every $ \\{ \\mathcal{T}_\\lambda : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This doesn't violate the third axiom because we're taking the intersection of sets of open sets, and it's not an intersection of open sets.\n"
