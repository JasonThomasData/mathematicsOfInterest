    "### Fundamental Theorem of Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Every non-constant polynomial of one variable with complex coefficients is a product of linear terms. \n",
    "\n",
    "This works for real coefficients too because those are complex numbers with 0 for their imaginary parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(z) = c_1 z^1 + c_2 z^2 + c_3 z^3 + ... + c_n z^n $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(z) = \\sum_\\limits{i=1}^n c_i z^i , c_n \\ne 0, n \\ge 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(z) = (z - \\zeta_1)...(z - \\zeta_n) $, where $ (z - \\zeta) $ is a linear term.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important implication is that if you are given a polynomial to any degree then you can find its roots, and the number of roots you should expect is the same degree as the polynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x^2 + 3x + 2 = (x + 1)(x + 2) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The polynomial above has real roots but it works also for complex roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lemma\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(z) = \\sum_\\limits{j=1}^n c_j z^j , c_n \\ne 0, n \\ge 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then either $ P(0) = 0 $ or there is some complex number $ \\gamma \\in \\mathbb{C} $ such that $ |P(\\gamma)| < |P(0)| $. So I think this means that if $ 0 $ in the domain has an image other than $ 0 $, then $ 0 \\le \\gamma < P(0) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $ P(0) $, then every term is going to be of the form: $ c_j 0^j $, and all of them will be $ 0 $. The only term that remains is the final constant that has no $ z=0 $. So therefore $ P(0) = c_0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $ P(0) \\ne 0 $. Then we know $ c_0 \\ne 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Let \n",
    "\n",
    "$ k > 0 $ be the smallest exponent such that $ P(z) \\ne c_0 $. I think this means that $ k = 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(z) = c_0 + c_k z^k + z^{k+1} g(z) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ g(z) $ is just some polynomial that is defined as having $ z^{k+1} $ factored out.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ f(z) = 1 + x^2 + 3x^3 - x^4 $\n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (c_0, c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4) = (1,0,1,3,-1) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest exponent such that the function doesn't return $ c_0 $ is $ k=2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we factor out $ x^{k+1} $ and it becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ f(z) = 1 + x^2 + x^3 (3 - x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "And so in this example, $ g(x) = (3 - x) $\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "OR DO I NEED THE t AS A COEFFICIENT AS ASKED IN THE FORUM?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that $ k, \\omega $ are fixed. $ g $ was defined as a polynomial and so $ h $ is also a poynomial.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\lim_\\limits{t \\to 0} ( h(t) ) = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, at $ t=0 $ then $ h(0) = 0 $\n",

    "So because $ h(t) $ can be very small, then it is possible to say:\n",

    "$ T > 0, |t| < T $ and that implies:\n",

    "$ |h(t)| < |c_0| $\n",

    "$ P(z) = c_0 + c_k z^k + z^{k+1} g(z) $\n",

    "\n",
    "$ |P(t\\omega)| < c_0 |1 -t^k| + t^k |c_0| $\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason to define $ t^k $ as being between $ (0,1) $ is that it cancels itself out:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ |P(t\\omega)| < |1 -t^k| c_0 + t^k |c_0| = |c_0| $\n",
    "\n",
    "So that means the result is $ |c_0| $\n",

    "The intuition for the above line is that the term with the highest exponent in $P(z)$, whether positive or negative, will dominate the polynomial.\n",
