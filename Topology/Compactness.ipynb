    "### Compactness\n",
    "\n",
    "This is analogous to finite but in the domain of Topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the open interval $ (0,1) \\subset \\mathbb{R} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this function is continuous\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (0, 1) \\to (-\\infty, 0) : x \\to \\log x $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this is its inverse:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (-\\infty, 0) \\to (0, 1) : x \\to e^x $\n",
    "\n",
    "Both functions are continuous and so this is a homeomorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "An observation we can make is this: despite $ (0,1) $ is bounded by $ 1 $, which means $ x < 1 $, $ (-\\infty, 0) $ is not bounded. So we can say this is not bounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this happens because the domain to start with was open. If it was closed, then it would be bounded.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this means that open and bounded is not a topological property, but closed and bounded is a topological property.\n",
    "\n",
    "_We can think of this notion \"closed and bounded\" as compactness._\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relation to homeomorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "If one space is homeomorphic to another, then the spaces share the property of compactness. If one is closed and bounded then so is the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A fundamental property in Topology\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ (X, \\mathcal{T}) $ be a topological space.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{ G_\\lambda : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda\\} $ be a collection of subsets, might be open and/or closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of subsets is a \"covering\" (noun) if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ X = \\bigcup_\\limits{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} G_\\lambda $\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a \"finite cover\" if the indexing set $ \\Lambda $ is also finite. This doesn't imply anything about each the cardinality of each individual $ G_\\lambda $.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's an \"open cover\" if the elements $ G_\\lambda $ are open.\n",
    "\n",
    "A \"sub cover\" is a subset of the $ G_\\lambda $. This is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{ G_\\mu : \\mu \\in M \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ M \\subset \\Lambda $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Given all of these, above\n",
    "\n",
    "We can say $ (X, \\mathcal{T}) $ is compact if every open cover admits a finite subcover.\n",
    "\n",
    "A subset $ A \\subseteq X $ is compact if it's compact with respect to the subspace topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition for this\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ X $ be compact\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{ G_\\lambda : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\} $ is an open cover. Then every $ G_\\lambda \\in \\mathcal{T} $, because each $ G_\\lambda $ is open. Recall that the topology $ \\mathcal{T} $ is all of the open sets in $ X $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then to show that $ X $ is compact we would need to show that the indexing set $ \\Lambda $ is finite, such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\Lambda = \\{ \\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, ..., \\lambda_n \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ X = \\bigcup_\\limits{i = 1}^n G_{\\lambda_i} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Above reads (G sub (lambda sub i)).\n",
    "\n",
    "An open interval can never be covered by open subsets so it can never be compact. This doesn't count as a proof and it's just some intuition.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every finite topological space is compact\n",
    "- $ \\mathbb{R} $ with the Euclidean topology is not compact\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, compactness is not a property of a set but a property of a topological space, and it's dependent on what the topology is.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The closed interval of any $ [a,b] $ is compact\n",
    "\n",
    "Given some $ [a, b] $ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a, b \\in \\mathbb{R}: a \\le b $\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $ a = b $, then $ [a,b] = \\{a\\} = \\{b\\} $ this is compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose $ a < b $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a cover: $ C = \\{(a_\\lambda, b_\\lambda) : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $ [a, b] \\subseteq \\bigcup_\\limits{\\lambda} (a_\\lambda, b\\lambda) $\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the cover might even be larger than the interval that it needs to cover.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that $ [a,b] $ is compact we must show that the cover admits a finite subcover.\n",
    "\n",
    "I couldn't fully grasph the proof. It's lecture 20 at ~ 41:00\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The continuous image of a compact space\n",
    "\n",
    "The continuous image of a compact space is compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ f: X \\to Y $ is continuous.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ X $ is compact then so is $ f(X) $. That doesn't mean that all of $ Y $ is compact, but just the range of the function $ f $.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a theorem for this in lecture 21 ~5:00\n",
    "\n",
    "Result: \"The union of the image is the image of the unions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The image of a compact set is compact, aka proper functions\n",
    "\n",
    "But not all functions are proper\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ f: X \\to Y , K \\subseteq Y $\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ K $ is compact then $ f^{-1}(K) $ is compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this is a proper function \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Every closed subset of a compact space is compact\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A \\subseteq X $, where $ A $ is closed and $ X $ is compact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fix an open cover of $ A $...\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ \\{ G_\\lambda : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\} $ be a collection of open subsets of $ X $.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A \\subseteq \\bigcup_\\limits{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} G_\\lambda $\n",
    "\n",
    "But because $ A $ is closed then its complement $ X $ \\ $ A $ is open.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{ G_\\lambda : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\} \\cup \\{ X $ \\ $ A \\} $ is an open cover of $ X $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ X $ \\ $ A \\cap A = \\emptyset $\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that $ A $ is in $ G_\\lambda $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $ X \\times Y $ is a compact iff $ X , Y $ are compact spaces\n",
