    "### Topological spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to stop thinking about metric spaces if we are going to achieve an abstract notion of continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let X be a set. A topology $ \\mathcal{T} $ on $ X $ is a collection of subsets of $ X $: $ \\mathcal{T} \\subseteq P(X) $. These are otherwise known as open sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Topological space (open set axioms)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $ (X, \\mathcal{T}) $ is a topological space. This must satisfy some axioms first:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ax 1) \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\emptyset , X \\in \\mathcal{T} $\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ax 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "if $ \\{ A_\\lambda: \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T} $ then $ \\bigcup\\limits_{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} A_\\lambda \\in \\mathcal{T} $\n",
    "\n",
    "I read this as \"If there are sets A-sub-lambda in the Topology, then the union of those sets is also in the topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $ \\mathcal{T} $ is closed under arbitrary unions.\n",

    "\n",
    "And I think this means that if there's a finite number of sets we want to focus on in the $ \\mathcal{T} $ then the union of those finite sets is also in the $ \\mathcal{T} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $ \\mathcal{T} $ is closed under finite intersections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples checking axioms\n",
    "\n",
    "For the examples, let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathcal{T}, \\mathcal{U} $ be topologies on the set $ X $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A union of topologies is generally not a topology\n",
    "\n",
    "Is $ \\mathcal{T} \\cup \\mathcal{U} $ a topology on $ X $?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ax 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ \\mathcal{T}, \\mathcal{U} $ are given as topologies then they must include $ \\emptyset, X $ \n",
    "\n",
    "So the $ \\mathcal{T} \\cup \\mathcal{U} $ must also include them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ax 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where we find $ \\mathcal{T} \\cup \\mathcal{U} $ is not a topology on $ X $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to find a single example where it fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathcal{T} = \\{\\emptyset, X, \\{1\\} \\} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathcal{U} = \\{\\emptyset, X, \\{2\\} \\} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "Then the axiom 2 suggests that since:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{1\\}, \\{2\\} \\in \\mathcal{T} \\cup \\mathcal{U} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{1\\} \\cup \\{2\\} \\in \\mathcal{T} \\cup \\mathcal{U} $\n",
    "\n",
    "But:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{1, 2\\} \\not \\in \\mathcal{T} \\cup \\mathcal{U} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\therefore $, the union is not a topology in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An intersection of two topologies is always a topology\n",
    "\n",
    "Is $ \\mathcal{T} \\cap \\mathcal{U} $ a topology on $ X $? It always is.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ax 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ \\mathcal{T}, \\mathcal{U} $ are given as topologies then they must include $ \\emptyset, X $ \n",
    "\n",
    "So the $ \\mathcal{T} \\cap \\mathcal{U} $ must also include them.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ax 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{ G_\\lambda : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T} \\cap \\mathcal{U} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{ G_\\lambda : \\lambda \\in \\Lambda \\} $ is in $ \\mathcal{T}, \\mathcal{U} $ individually (because of the intersection)\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\bigcup_\\limits{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} G_\\lambda $ is in $ \\mathcal{T}, \\mathcal{U} $ individually\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\bigcup_\\limits{\\lambda \\in \\Lambda} G_\\lambda $ is in $ \\mathcal{T} \\cap \\mathcal{U} $ \n",
    "\n",
    "##### ax 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "This uses the same argument as above, and it is also true.\n",
    "\n",
    "So therefore this example of an intersection is a topological space but it should be no surprise since all unions of topologies are topologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Induced Topology\n",
    "\n",
    "If a topology applies to a metric space to create a topological space, then it is \"induced\" or a \"metric topology\".\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's suppose that $ (X, \\rho) $ is verified as a metric space.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathcal{T} = \\{U \\in X: U\\space \\text{is open with respect to}\\space \\rho \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, $ \\mathcal{T} $ is a topology on $ X $, if $ U \\in X $ \n",
    "\n",
    "If one metric induces a topology, then we should expect many metrics to induce the same topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with a metric gives a unique topology, but starting with a metrisable topology doesn't give you a unique metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Euclidean Topology\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ X = R^n $ and $ \\rho $ is the Eucldian Metric, then the induced topology is the Euclidean Topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a topology induced from the Euclidian Metric, then if it is finite, then the interior $ A^o = \\emptyset $. This is because an open ball in the real number line is an open interval, which has an uncountably infinite number of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Indiscrete Topology\n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest topology (fewest open sets) is $ \\mathcal{T} = \\{ \\emptyset, X \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Discrete Topology\n",
    "\n",
    "The largest topology (most open sets) is $ \\mathcal{T} = P(X) $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partial topology\n",
    "\n",
    "A partial order is something like $ \\le $. It is not an equivalence relation because it is not symmetric. But it is reflexive and it is transitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let there be a topology $ (X, \\mathcal{T}) $. Let there be a set $ A $, $ A \\subseteq X $. Then $ \\mathcal{T} $ is partialy ordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interior of partial topology\n",
    "\n",
    "Let there be a topology $ (X, \\mathcal{T}) $. Let there be a set $ A $, $ A \\subseteq X $. Let $ A^o $ be the largest open subset of $ X $ wrt the partial order $ \\subseteq $.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A^o \\in \\mathcal{T} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A^o \\subseteq A $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the below observation holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ G \\in \\mathcal{T} $ and $ G \\subseteq A $ then $ G \\subseteq A^o $\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a theorem: every $ A \\subseteq X $ has a unique interior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A topology as the complement of closed sets\n",
    "\n",
    "See the notebook on closed sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ F \\subseteq P(X) $, be the set of all close subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Go through the axioms for $ F $ in the notebook on closed sets. If $ F $ meets the axioms to be the subset of all closed sets, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathcal{T} = \\{ X \\text{\\\\} f : f \\in F \\} $ defines the topology on $ X $."
