    "$ (X, g) $\n",

    "where $ X $ is a set and $ g $ is a function.\n",

    "This condition stipulates the conditions under which the function returns $ 0 $. This can only happen when the elements are the same, because the distance between them is $ 0 $.\n",

    "This means that given three points in the set then there are three lines connecting them. There must be one side that is the longest or is the same length as the others and yet it must be smaller than the other two combined. This is a consequence of the triangle inequality theorem. It would be very interesting to find a space that doesn't support this condition given the distance between two points.\n"
