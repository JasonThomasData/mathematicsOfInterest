    "### Open sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall the Epsilon-Delta notion of continuity. Regarding the codomain, where g is a metric then $ g(X, a) \\le \\delta $\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent this as an open interval $ (a - \\delta, a + \\delta) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (X, g) $ is a metric space.\n",

    "\n",
    "$ B(a;r) = \\{x \\in X: g(x, a) < r \\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then above we defined an open ball. It's open because the inequality is strictly less than $ r $.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nice thing about an open ball is that $ \\forall x \\in B(a;r) $, there is a radius $ s > 0 $ where $ B(x;s) \\subset B(a;r) $.\n",

    "I have seen a nice proof on this subject but didn't have time to write it down. It involves the triangle equality and would be a great proof to learn so I can think about it on the train :D\n",

    "\n",
    "This is the union of all sets that are open in $ S $. The proof uses the concept of an open ball.\n",

    "### Closed sets\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is closed if its complement is open, and vice-versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major misconception is that sets are either open or closed, but this is not true. A set can be neither open nor closed. For example subsets of a topological space can be not open or closed. They can also be open and closed... according to the lecturer, not sure how.\n",

    "### The closure of a set \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ A \\subseteq X $, sucn that $ (X, \\mathbb{T}) $ is a topological space. $ A $ is any set, open or not.\n",

    "The proof: \n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ F \\subseteq P(X) $ be all closed sets containing $ A $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that $ \\emptyset, X \\in F $ (see the definition of a closed set). Then $ F \\ne \\emptyset $ because it must contain $ X $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\bar{A} = \\bigcap_{K \\in F} K $, so in other words we intersect all of the closed sets that contain $ A $. Then $ \\bar{A} $ is closed (because it's an intersection of closed sets). Then all $ K $ contain $ A $, because of the definition for $ F $.\n",
    "\n",
    "To show $ \\bar{A}$ is the smallest, if $ J $ is any other closed set that contains $ A $, then $ J \\in F $, and $ \\bar{A} \\in J $.\n",

    "We use the definition from before: \n",
    "\n",
    "We can say $ A \\subseteq X $ is dense in $ B $ if $ \\bar{A} = B $\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\mathbb{Q} $ is dense in $ \\mathbb{R} $. There's one closed set that contains all of the rational numbers, and it is all $ \\mathbb{R} $. But also $ \\mathbb{R} \\text{\\\\} \\mathbb{Q} $ is dense in $ \\mathbb{R} $\n",
