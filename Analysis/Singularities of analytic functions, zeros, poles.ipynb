    "### Singularities of analytic functions, zeros, poles\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ f(z) $ is analytic then if $ f(z) $ is not analytic at the point $ z_0 $, then that point is a singularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example suppose $ \\frac{1}{z-3} $ is analytic. It can't be analytic where it's undefined so $ z = 3 $ is a singularity.\n",

    "![types of singularities](Screenshot_2023-10-02_10-12-20.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, a way to characterise removeable poles is that there limit approaching $ a $ is defined and is finite:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\lim_\\limits{z\\to a} f(z) $ is finite, then $ a $ is removeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important for complex analysis is a pole:\n",

    "\n",
    "If $ g(z) $ is a removeable singularity, then we are interested in the smallest power $ m $ that makes it possible. This is called the order of the pole.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pole of order 1 is a simple pole.\n",

    "\n",
    "$ f: D \\to \\mathbb{C} $\n",
    "\n",
    "If a singularity is a pole then for $ z \\in D $, $ \\lim_\\limits{z \\to a} |f(z)| = \\infty $. It diverges, in the sense we learned about with Real Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once $ a $ is confirmed to be a pole in the function $ f(z) $ then you get $ h(z) = (z-a)^m f(z) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $ h(z) $ now has a removeable singularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, $ f(z) = (z-a)^{-m}h(z) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ h(z) \\ne 0 $\n",

    "#### Casorati-Weierstrass Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ a $ is an essential singularity of an analytic function $ f: D \\to \\mathbb{C} $, and $ D \\subset \\mathbb{C} $ is an open set. If $ U^* = U \\backslash \\{a\\} $ is an arbitrary punctured neighbourhood of $ a $ then the image $ f(U^* \\cap D) $ is dense in $ \\mathbb{C} $ then for any $ b \\in \\mathbb{C} $ and $ \\epsilon > 0 $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ f(U^* \\cap D) \\cap U_{\\epsilon}(b) \\ne \\emptyset $\n",
    "\n",
    "And this means that since it's dense for any number $ b $ in $ \\mathbb{C} $, we can find an arbitrarily small set that will serve as a decent approximation if we let $ \\epsilon $ get small enough.\n",

    "#### Big theorem of Pickard\n",
    "\n",
    "Note there is also a little theorem, related.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ a $ is an essential singularity of an analytic function $ f: D \\to \\mathbb{C} $ then for a punctured neighbourhood $ U^* \\subset D $, there are two possible cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ f(U^*) = \\mathbb{C} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ f(U^*) = \\mathbb{C} \\backslash \\{c\\} $, for some suitable $ c $\n"
