    "### Infimum and supremum\n",
    "\n",
    "These concepts will overlap with Topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ A $ be a subset of the reals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A \\subset \\mathbb{R} $ Note, can't be equal to $ \\mathbb{R} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x \\in A $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A $ is bounded if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ M \\in \\mathbb{R} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\forall x : M \\ge x $\n",
    "\n",
    "There might be a lot of $ M $ that exist but consider the smallest possible $ M $ that meets these criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can say that \"the least possible $ M $ that bounds $ A $ is the supremum\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Let this be the notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ m,M $ for any lower and upper bounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sup $ or $ M'$  for the Supremum\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\inf $ or $ m' $ for the Infimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unbounded\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A \\subset \\mathbb{R} $ is unbounded from above iff: $ \\sup A = +\\infty $ \n",
    "\n",
    "$ A \\subset \\mathbb{R} $ is unbounded from below iff: $ \\inf A = -\\infty $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $ \\emptyset $ is unbounded\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\sup \\emptyset = -\\infty $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\inf \\emptyset = +\\infty $\n",
    "\n",
    "If it was the opposite with $ \\sup \\emptyset = +\\infty $ then that would imply that something is in the set, but we know it's empty, so it can't be that way.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Infimum and supremum are unique\n",
    "\n",
    "If they exist, then they are unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Infimum and supremum may or may not be in the set they bound\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{Q} : x < \\sqrt{2} \\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a proof that $ \\sqrt{2} \\not \\in \\mathbb{Q} $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any open set will not contain its $ \\sup, \\inf $\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any closed set will not do so\n",
    "\n",
    "- A hybrid, eg $ (0, 1] $ will contain its $ \\sup $ but $ \\inf $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition for $ \\sup $\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A \\subset \\mathbb{R}, A \\ne \\emptyset, M \\in \\mathbb{R} $, where $ M $ is an upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Supremum is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ M = \\sup A $ __iff__:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\forall x \\in A: x < M $ __AND__\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\forall \\epsilon > 0, \\exists x' \\in A, x' > M - \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ x' $ is the largest value of $ x $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof for the definition\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (\\Rightarrow) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ M = \\sup A $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ M $ is the smallest value that bounds $ A $ from above, and that implies $ \\forall x \\in A: x < M $\n",
    "\n",
    "Also:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ \\epsilon $ be the positive limit approaching $ 0 $. Then $ x' > M - \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (\\Leftarrow) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\forall x \\in A: x < M $ __AND__\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\forall \\epsilon > 0, \\exists x' \\in A, x' > M - \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider the first supposition by itself, then $ M $ is an upper bound.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we also consider the second supposition then take a particular $ \\epsilon $ to be the positive limit approaching $ 0 $, then if some $ x' > M - \\epsilon $ implies $ M $ must be the smallest possible value of any upper bound, and this is otherwise known as the $ M = \\sup A $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### $ \\sup A $,  where $ A $ is monotonic and increasing, is the limit\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ A \\subset \\mathbb{R} $ be an increasing monotonic sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then if the supremum is not $ \\infty $ then this means the set $ A $ is bounded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, if the function is \"not decreasing\" then it's bounded above.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ M = \\sup x $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\{x_k \\} < M $\n",
    "\n",
    "So $ \\forall x_k \\le \\sup x $\n",
    "\n",
    "But: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall \\epsilon > 0, \\exists K(\\epsilon), \\forall k > K(\\epsilon): x_k > M - \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_k > M - \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "But so is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ M + \\epsilon > x_k $\n",
    "\n",
    "And we can express those last two facts as a single statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ | x_k - M | < \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we put that back into the original statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\forall \\epsilon > 0, \\exists K(\\epsilon), \\forall k > K(\\epsilon): x_k > M - \\epsilon $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sometimes you can write the sequence in terms of $ k+1 $, and if we can show a monotonic sequence is bounded above, then it converges"
