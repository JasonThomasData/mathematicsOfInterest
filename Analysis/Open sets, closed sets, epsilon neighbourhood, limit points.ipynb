    "### Epsilon neighbourhood in a metric space\n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking about a $(\\mathbb{R}^n, d) $ metric space then a good way to interpret the $ \\epsilon $ that we would use for the real line is to imagine $ \\epsilon $ is the radius of a ball\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\bar x $ is the limit\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (\\mathbb{R}^n, d) $ is a metric space\n",
    "\n",
    "Then\n",
    "\n",
    "$ O_\\epsilon(\\bar x) = \\{x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n, d(x,\\bar x) < \\epsilon \\} $\n",

    "\n",
    "With the above definition, consider a point on the border of $ S $. There is no way you can draw an open ball, with $ r > 0 $, that is contained within $ S $\n",
    "\n",
    "_Using open balls is a good way to understand what is meant by the criteria for a topology: the arbitrary union of open sets, is also open._\n",

    "\n",
    "In a closed interval, a sequence is bounded above and below by points $ a, b $, which are constant sequences. If a sequence has only one number then it converges to itself. Since the sequence inside the closed interval is within two convergent sequences, then by the sandwich theorem, the sequence inside the bounded interval converges.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given a closed set $ S $, which is a set that contains its boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "PIC\n",
    "\n",
    "Then imagine there is a point $ \\bar x $ on the border of $ S $. This is also a limit point.\n",

    "Draw a ball around this point, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ O(\\bar x, \\epsilon) \\cap S \\ne \\emptyset $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then since the set has an overlap with S, then $ \\epsilon > 0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can use this fact to choose some $ K $ such that $ k \\le K $, all points of $ x_k \\subset S $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not true for open sets, because an open set doesn't contain its limit points, so there is no way for the limit of $ \\bar x $ to sit on the border of an open set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open and closed sets\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a notebook in the \\Topology folder on the same concept. This notebook talks about limits and then makes abstractions of those.\n",

    "What this means is, imagine any point of $ S $. Draw a ball around it of any $\\epsilon$, and you should also capture a bunch of $ x \\in S $ that are in the ball.\n",

    "If you started with a ball, to define a set $ \\{x_k\\} $, of $ \\epsilon $ radius and then reduced the $ \\epsilon $ then you would see the that the centre of the ball is what the sequence converges to. \n",
