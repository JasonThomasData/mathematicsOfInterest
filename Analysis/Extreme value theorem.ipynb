    "Theorem: if $ f : [a, b] \\to \\mathbb{R} $ is continuous then $ f $ has a maximum and a minimum.\n",

    "\n",
    "Useful lemma: if $ S \\subset \\mathbb{R} , S \\ne \\emptyset $ then if the $ \\sup(S) = M < \\infty $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there exists a sequence $ S_k \\subset S, S_k \\to M $\n",
    "\n",
    "And what this means is we can take a sequence of elements in $ S $ that get closer and closer to the supremum.\n",

    "Proof for the lemma:\n",

    "Forall $ k $: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ M - \\frac{1}{k} < M = \\sup(M) $\n",

    "But there will always be some value of $ S_k $ that is larger than $ M - \\frac{1}{k} $\n",

    "We were given that $ f $ is continuous.\n",

    "$ |f(x)| < \\epsilon $\n",

    "_This last part is not rigorous but it captures the idea_\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the domain is bounded and since the function doesn't go to infinity, then the range is closed and bounded also (compact).\n",
