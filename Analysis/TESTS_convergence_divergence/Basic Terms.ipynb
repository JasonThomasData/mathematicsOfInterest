    "### Basic terms\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis is the study of infinite processes. For example, does the harmonic series equal a finite number? We can show that it doesn't via analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sequence vs series\n",
    "\n",
    "In analysis, a sequence is a set of numbers that have some order and may have duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A series is the sum of a sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Infinite series\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sum of an infinite number of terms, AKA an infinite sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_n $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partial sum\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a sum of a sequence up until some index:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\displaystyle \\sum_{n=1}^N a_n = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + ... + a_N $\n",
    "\n",
    "It's like a running total ending at $ N $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "Where an infinite series of any $ a_n $ adds up to a finite number.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ S = \\sum \\limits_{n=1}^N a_n, N \\to \\infty $\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the partial sum adds up to a finite number as the largest index tends to infinity. I mean the value of the index not the value of the sequence element at that index.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the partial sum described for convergence doesn't converge, and tends to infinity."
