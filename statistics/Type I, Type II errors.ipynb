    "The way to interpret this is to say that the probablity of a Type I error occuring is $ \\alpha $, because $ \\alpha $ is the area about the critical value, determined by the level of confidence in a one-tail test.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example if you run a test with $ \\alpha = 0.05 $ then that $ \\alpha $ is the integral to the right of the critical value (that determines the region of rejection). The test statistic that falls above this and leads to rejection the $ H_0 $ is wrong if the sample distribution varies too much from the population's distribution, in which case we should have accepted $ H_0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are going to reject the $ H_0 $ if the test statistic falls above the critical region, which is the area under the curve equal to $ \\alpha $, then you effectively say that you are confortable with a 5% chance of a Type I error occuring.\n",
