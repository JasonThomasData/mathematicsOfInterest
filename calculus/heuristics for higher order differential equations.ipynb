    "### Heuristic approaches to solving higher order ordinary differential equations\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the mantra is that `linear is easy, non-linear is hard`. So it seems like the aim of these heuristic methods is to break a non-linear problem into a combination of linear problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homogoenous second order differntial equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a problem in the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ ay'' + by' + cy = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can suppose that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = e^{mx} $\n",
    "\n",
    "That implies that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y' = me^{mx}, y'' = m^2e^{mx} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a \\cdot m^2e^{mx} + b \\cdot me^{mx} + c \\cdot e^{mx} = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ e^{mx}(am^2 + bm + c) = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful because now we have a quadratic function to solve:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ am^2 + bm + c = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "For any polynomial of degree 2, we know that there are two roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could solve for $ m $, to find the roots for the polynomial. Those might be the same (one x intercept), different (two x-intercepts) or complex (for a polynomial with no x-intercepts).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the solved values of $ m $ are $ r_1, r_2 $ then the polynomial is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (m-r_1)(m-r_2) = am^2 + bm + c = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "But recall that we factored out the supposed $ y = e^{mx} $. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ e^{mx}(m-r_1)(m-r_2) = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we have a solution to find y, but substituting the roots of the polynomial for $ m $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = C_1 e^{r_1 x} + C_2 e^{r_2 x} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the general solution where $ C_1, C_2 $ are some unknown constants. To find a specific solution you would need to define the starting value of $y, x$ and then solve for $C$\n",
    "\n",
    "I think you could use this for any degree ODE, but then you would potentially have to find complex roots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y'' - 4y' + 3y = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then suppose:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = e^{mx} $\n",
    "\n",
    "That implies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y' = me^{mx} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y'' = m^2e^{mx} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ m^2e^{mx} - 4 \\cdot me^{mx} + 3 \\cdot e^{mx} = 0 $ \n",
    "\n",
    "$  e^{mx}(m^2 - 4m + 3) = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this is a quadratic function to solve. We don't even need to complete the square.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (m - 1)(m - 3) = m^2 - 4m + 3 = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ e^{mx}(m - 1)(m - 3) = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the general solution to the linear equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = C_1e^x + C_2e^{3x} $\n",
    "\n",
