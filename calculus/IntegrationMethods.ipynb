    "At RMIT, the Calc1 lecturer had this to say as a checklist for solving an integral problem:\n",

    "1. Is it simple?\n",
    "2. Can you use substitution?\n",
    "3. Can it be done by parts?\n",
    "4. Can you find a formula in a table? (People have solved many hard problems before and recorded them in tables. Give values names so that you can recognise when a formula is a appropriate).\n",
    "5. Change how it looks. Make it cosmetically different. Write terms in different forms from their definitions. This may make you realise it is solveable in some other way. Once it looks different, try steps 1-3 again."
