This is a warehouse for algorithms/things I learn that are interesting.

I wholly intend to reinvent the wheel, without packages, where possible so that I can learn more.

If you happen to stumble on this then know that I am not yet a qualified mathematician. As the Russians say: trust but verify.

### Setup

I'm switching to use Jupyter Notebooks where possible. These now support Octave and R as well.

Do:

	virtualenv venv -p python3
	source venv/bin/activate
	
	pip install -r requirements_octave.txt
	pip install -r requirements_python.txt
	./installRNotebook.sh
	./enableVimKeys.sh
