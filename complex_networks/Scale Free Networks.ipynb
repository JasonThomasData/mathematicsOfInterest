    "### Scale-free networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world networks are not random. They are scale-free\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Check if a network is scale-free\n",
    "\n",
    "When asking is a network scale free, a lot of researchers will check the data on a graph, and if the line is straight (fit to data) then we will find that the network is scale-free.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear-linear plot\n",
    "\n",
    "Where values of $ k $ are negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y = ax^k $\n",
    "\n",
    "![linear linear](Screenshot_2023-09-01_14-21-06.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\ln(y) = \\ln(ax^k) = \\ln(a) + k \\ln(x) $\n",

    "![log log](Screenshot_2023-09-01_14-23-28.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Semi-log plot\n",
    "\n",
    "This time the scale is $ y = Ae^{kx} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then plot the functions for $ \\pm k $\n",
    "\n",
    "![semi-log plot](Screenshot_2023-09-01_14-27-36.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\ln(y) = \\ln(A) + kx $\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Power laws and degree distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "The proportion of nodes in a network that have degree k, follows this pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ p_k \\approx k^{-\\gamma} $, where $ \\gamma > 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\gamma $ is the degree exponent.\n",
    "\n",
    "degree is the number of edges\n",
    "\n",
    "### Now, on to scale free\n",
    "\n",
    "A scale free network is one that has a degree distribution that follows the power law.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any function that obeys this relation is scale-free:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ h(ak) = bh(k) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ a $ and $ b $ are constants. \n",
    "\n",
    "It means: if you change the scale of the $ x $ axis, you can then change the scale of $ y $ to produce _exactly the same function curve_. You could first change $ y $ and then $ x $ to fit, and it's equivalent.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can't do that to the Normal or Binomial distributions, and they are certainly not scale free. So \n",
    "\n",
    "![scale free functions](Screenshot_2023-09-01_14-57-53.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A scale-free example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider\n",
    "\n",
    "$ h(k) = k^{-\\gamma} $\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we scale it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ h(a\\cdot k) = (ak)^{-\\gamma} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ b \\cdot h(k) = (ak)^{-\\gamma} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ b = \\frac{h(a\\cdot k)}{h(k)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ b = \\frac{(ak)^{-\\gamma}}{h^{-\\gamma}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ b = \\frac{a^{-\\gamma} k^{-\\gamma}}{h^{-\\gamma}} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ b = a^{-\\gamma}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Discrete formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "![discrete formalism](Screenshot_2023-09-03_10-03-43.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nodes with degree $ 0 $ aren't meaningful in real networks, usually, so the calculation becomes easier if we set $ p_0 = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ C = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{k=1}^\\infty k^{-\\gamma}} = \\frac{1}{\\zeta(\\gamma)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator is called the Reimann-Zeta function.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\zeta(s) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^s} $\n",
    "\n",
    "And the point of it is to make sure $ p_k $ add up to 1. Do it again, if it's not equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuous formalism\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason to switch between discrete and continuous is that sometimes the networks are really large, so they're effectively not discrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "But below, we use $ kmin $. Sometimes we need to change $ kmin $ because some networks have nodes with unhelpful degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "![continuous formalism](Screenshot_2023-09-03_10-15-19.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Treat $ C $ as constant and integrate as normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "We get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ C = (\\gamma - 1)k_{min}^{\\gamma - 1}k^{-\\gamma} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ p_k = (\\gamma - 1)k_{min}^{\\gamma - 1}k^{-\\gamma} p^{-\\gamma} $\n",

    "### Hubs\n",

    "If you present them on a log scale then you will see the scale-free distribution has a heavy tail:\n",

    "\n",
    "![log log plot](Screenshot_2023-09-03_10-30-59.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "With the scale free networks, you can understand that hubs will emerge.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in social networks the mega hubs are celebrities. Most people just have a few edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implication here is that the mean, median etc that represent the Poisson Distribution, have no value when you have a scale free distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lecturer said that scale-free is an extreme characteristic for a distribution to have.\n",
    "\n",
