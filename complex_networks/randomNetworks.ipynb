    "\n",
    "#### Binomial distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "$ G(N, P) $ is a random network where\n",
    "\n",
    "$ N $ is the number of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P $ is the probability that any two nodes are connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In generating the network, it's a series of bernoulli trials, in the sense that connecting two networks, you flip a weighted coin according to $ P $.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ L $ is the number of edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ Pr(L) = P_L $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P_L = P^L (1 - P)^{1/2 N(N-1) - L} $\n",

    "#### Expected number of edges\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P \\frac{1}{2} N(N - 1) $\n",

    "Example with some emperical data:\n",

    "![example](Screenshot_2023-08-11_14-39-25.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expected average node degree\n",
    "\n",
    "We can find its expected average node degree:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ K = P (N-1) $\n",
    "\n",
    "For the previous example, this would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "For $ G\\left(7, \\frac{1}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{3} (7-1) = 2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT VARIANCE\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Poisson Distribtribution\n",
    "\n",
    "![poisson distribution](Screenshot_2023-08-11_15-16-28.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Max and min degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "Let:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ k_\\text{max} $ be the maximum value of $ k $ such that there is at most 1 node with degree greater than $ k_\\text{max} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, recall for a discrete variable we can have a PMF that looks like a step function. However when you have lots of nodes then the shape of the PMF approaches what looks like a PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then this is whY a Poisson distribution's CDF would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Screenshot_2023-08-11_15-58-28.png)\n",

    "Week 4 lecture goes into how to calculate $ k_\\text{max} $... I lost energy at this point, see notes.\n",

    "#### Distribution of random graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "![distribution with respect to degree](Screenshot_2023-08-12212121.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "$ <k> = \\ln(N) $ (is the critical region)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $ \\ln(N) $ here is where random graphs $ G(N, p) $\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, the number of nodes in the largest component becomes approximately the same as the network itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proof \n",
    "\n",
    "So $ N \\approx N_G $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the probability of a random node not being in $ N_G $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ = (1 - P)^{N_G} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\approx (1 - P)^{N} $\n",
    "\n",
    "So the number of nodes that are note connected to $ N_G $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ N(1-P)^N < 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ N(1-\\frac{NP}{N})^N < 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then it looks a lot like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ (1 - \\frac{x}{n})^n \\approx e^{-x} $\n",
    "\n",
    "With $ x = NP $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then \n",
    "\n",
    "$ Ne^{-NP} < 1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "So, solve $ Ne^{-NP} = 1 $ for $ P = \\frac{<k>}{N} $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then $ k = \\ln(N) $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small world property\n",
    "\n",
    "In a random network, take a random node. The expected number of nodes that are a path distance of 1 is expected to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ <k> $\n",
    "\n",
    "As in, this is the average degree of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of nodes two hops away, or in a path of 2 (and without backtracking) be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ <k>(<k> - 1) $\n",
    "\n",
    "And 3 hops:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ <k>(<k> -1)^2 $ \n",
    "\n",
    "And generally\n",
    "\n",
    "$ <k>(<k> - 1)^{d-1} $, where $ d $ is diameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "And if we define $ dmax $ to be the maximum diameter. This is a property specific to a Cayley Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ <k>(<k> - 1)^{dmax - 1} $\n",
    "\n",
    "So:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ dmax = \\frac{\\ln(N)}{\\ln(<k>)} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This dmax is a bound for the diameter but also a bound for the average path length. \n",
    "\n",
    "On Cayley Trees, these are the worst case scenario, because to get to any leaf node you need to take a path that is the full diameter of the graph/tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for a cayley tree, the diameter is the average path length from the root to any leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both random networks and real world networks are considered small world.\n",
    "\n",
    "![small world networks](Screenshot_2023-08-25_12-25-50.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "So the average path length scales with $ \\ln N $. The average path length, as a function of $ N $, grows very slowly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense in terms of social networks because you know people in Sydney, Adelaide etc. Our networks are not constricted spatially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between random and real networks is the clustering coefficient, and not the path length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember back to the clustering coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "How often does a triangle form in the network $ G(N,p) $? The answer is $ p $.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have $ G(10000, 0.001) $ has $ <k> = 10 $ \n",
    "\n",
    "And this is true because of the definition for $ k $:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ k = p(N-1) $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ G(10000, 0.001) = 10000 * 0.001 = 10 $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Watts-Strogatz model \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a k-regular network, which is also a ring graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ k $ denotes the maximum distance away that a node can be connected. eg a 2-regular network has node $ 4 $ that is connected to $ \\{2, 3, 5, 6\\} $. Then every node has degree $ 4 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was the first model for a random graph where both of these principles apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small world property: average path length scales with $ \\ln N $ rather than in a linear way, as in lattice-like graphs.\n",
    "- High clustering coefficient: as with real-world networks, the clustering coefficient is higher with this model, compared to random graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "See the notebook on this for more (full simulation).\n"
