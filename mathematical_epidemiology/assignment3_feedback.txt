In question 1 you missed the asymmetry in the transmission rates from males to females versus females to males but otherwise did a fine job. For question 2 and 3, your expression for R0 (and the individual elements of K too) is out by a factor of 1/2. This is most clearly seen in Q3 when you linearised the infectious subsystem around the DFE and ignored S*_f and S*_m which are both equal to Â½ at the DFE.

For question 4, a full answer requires a heat map or surface plot showing how the final numbers of koalas depend on alpha and mu, but you did a decent job here and found (very roughly) the part of parameter space that predicts koala extinction.

The focus is on whether the koalas go extinct or not, so we would want to solve the model numerically and plot the population size after say 100 years since the introduction of Chlamydia. The long-term population size will depend on mu and alpha, and hence you get a surface plot or a heat map where the height (or colour) indicates the final population size. A population size of 0 (or very, very close to 0) indicates extinction has occurred.

The faceted chart is indeed useful but ideally is a precursor to the heat map I just described.

From the faceted chart we understand there are three possible outcomes in the long term. The pathogen goes extinct (e.g. when mu=0.4), an endemic equilibrium is reached (e.g. when mu=0.1) or the koalas go extinct (and so too does the pathogen; e.g. mu=0.2, alpha=0.3).

The heat map shows which parts of parameter space lead to which outcome.
